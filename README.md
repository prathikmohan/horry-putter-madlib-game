#### horry-putter-madlib-game

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud to everyone. The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and/or takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone!

How to play?
- Download the madlib.py file and run.
- Input the keywords that the game asks and read aloud the horry putter story at the end! Enjoy :) Feel free to contribute to more stories!

#### The code is made using string concatanation operation in python3. I have given example of 3 types of concatanation techniques within the code. If you are not familiar with nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, then you might want to check below.

Nouns
Nouns are names of person, places, or things.

Verbs are action words. You may need to change the verb you use another tense by adding –ed or –ing.

Adjectives
Adjectives are descriptive words. They modify or tell about nouns.
Examples:
abundant	delightful	high	nutritious	square

Adverbs
Adverbs tell how something is done. They modify (tell about) a verb, adjective, or another adjective. They frequently end in –ly.
